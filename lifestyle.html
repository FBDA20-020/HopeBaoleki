             Istanbul city is full with famous brands whether luxury or medium class from both local and international. Although Turkish brands were not famous around the world but by the beginning of 1980s the Turkish designers who contributed in international fashion exhibitions have been able to leave a good impression in fashion lovers all around the world. Slowly and year after year, the fashion in Istanbul had grown to a point where it got the respect of the international fashion community.Todayâ€™s situation of the fashion field in Istanbul is absolutely fabulous, Turkish brands have made it to the top of international markets and people from all over the world come to Istanbul city every year only for shopping. It might be crazy but true because Istanbul offers a very wide collection of fashion with relatively cheaper prices compared to other countries in Europe.
