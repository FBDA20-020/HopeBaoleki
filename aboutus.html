               The first inhabitants of Istanbul lived on the Asian side of the city and date back to the second millennium BC. It gets its first name from Megara king Byzas, who brought his colonists here in the 7th century BC to found a colony called Byzantium, which is the Greek name for a city on the Bosphorus. Byzas chose this location after meeting with a Delphi oracle, who advised him to settle across from the "land of the blind." Indeed, Byzas claimed that earlier settlers must have been "blind" for missing this magnificent position at the mouth of the Bosphorus strait, the Black Sea's only access point.It’s such a pleasure to explore Istanbul, its unique attractions and historical places.
